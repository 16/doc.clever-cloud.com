# Scala overview

The Clever Cloud allows you to deploy Scala and Java applications built with Simple Build Tool.
This document will explain you how to set up your app to run on our service.

You only need to meet two conditions.

## Always listen on the 8080 port

First, your application must be set to listen on the 8080 port, for worldwide
connections.

## Use the "sbt-start-script" plugin

For now, you need to add the sbt-start-script plugin to your project.

That plugin will add the "stage" goal that we will use to create a target/start
script we will execute.

In project/plugins.sbt:

{% highlight scala %}
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" % "sbt-start-script" % "0.7.0")
{% endhighlight %}

You can also use newer (or older) versions of the plugin.

Prepend to build.sbt:

{% highlight scala %}
import com.typesafe.sbt.SbtStartScript

seq(SbtStartScript.startScriptForClassesSettings: _*)
{% endhighlight %}

That should be enough for a project with a main method.

For more configuration, please go to <a href="https://github.com/sbt/sbt-start-script">https://github.com/sbt/sbt-start-script</a>.
