#PHP

PHP is available on our platform with the version 5.3.16. You can use FTP or Git to deploy your applications.

**CAUTION**: Currently there is no data persistence when using Git deploy, autogenerated content (eg. with Drupal, Wordpress or Joomla) will be destroyed on each redeploy. We recommend to use FTP deploy at this time.

## Deployment via FTP 
To deploy via a FTP client, see details here: <a href="/php/ftp-deploy.html">FTP Deploy</a>.  

## Deployment via Git
To deploy via Git, see details here: <a href="/php/git-deploy.html">Git Deploy</a>.
