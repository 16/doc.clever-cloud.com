# Node.js basics

You can deploy any node application on the Clever Cloud. You need a little
specific configuration.

### Always listen on the 8080 port

First, your application must be set to listen on the 8080 port, for worldwide
connections.

    http.createServer({ â€¦ }).listen(8080);

### Provide a package.json file

For every Node.js project you have to provide a <a href="/package.json">package.json</a> file at the root of your project's directory.

### Deployment via Git

To deploy via Git, see details here: <a href="/git-deploy-node">Git deploy</a>.
