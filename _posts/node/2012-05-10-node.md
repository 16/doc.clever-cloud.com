# Node.js basics

The Clever Cloud allows you to deploy any node application. This document will
explain you how to set up your app to run on our service.

You do not need to change a lot in your application. Let’s see
the only configuration elements you need:

## Always listen on the 8080 port

First, your application must be set to listen on the 8080 port, for worldwide
connections. The following code describe a Hello world application listening on
that port:
{% highlight javascript%}
// Load the http module to create an http server.
var http = require('http');

// Configure our HTTP server to respond with Hello World to all requests.
var server = http.createServer(function (request, response) {
  response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/plain"});
  response.end("Hello World\n");
});

// Last, but not leat, listen on port 8080
server.listen(8080);
{% endhighlight %}

## Provide a package.json file 


For every Node.js project you **HAVE TO** provide a <a
href="/node-dependencies/">package.json</a> file at the root of your project’s
directory. That file is detailed here : [Node dependencies](/node-dependencies).


### Deployment via Git
