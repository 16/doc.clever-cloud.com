# the package.json file

For every Node.js application you want to deploy on the Clever Cloud, you need
to provide a `package.json` file at the root of your project’s directory.

The package.json should *at least* contain the following fields:

    {
        "main" : "myapp.js",
        "scripts" : {
            "start" : "node myapp.js"
        },
        "engines" : {
            "node" : ">=0.6"
        }
    }

main
: should be the relative path to the main file we will start using node.

scripts.start
: if you prefer something more complicated, just provide a `script.start` field *instead of* the `main` one.

engines.node
: sets the node engine version you app runs with. Any ">=" version will lead to run the application with the latest local version (which will be updated to the latest version at the moment).
