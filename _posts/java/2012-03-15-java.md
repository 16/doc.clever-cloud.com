# How to deploy java applications?

At the moment there are 4 ways to create a java application that the
Clever Cloud supports.

- [Maven](/java-maven/)
- [Play1](/play-framework/#play_12x)
- [Play2](/play-framework/#play_2)
- [WAR/EAR](/java-war/)

## Requirements for all applications

Your application must be set to listen on the port 8080.

## Deployment via Git
The java projects only support Git deployment.
