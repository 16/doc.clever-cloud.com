#PHP basics

PHP is available on our platform with the version 5.3.16. You can use FTP or Git to deploy your applications.

<div class="alert alert-hot-problems">
	<h4>Caution:</h4>
	<p>Currently there is no data persistence when using Git deploy, autogenerated content (eg. with Drupal, Wordpress or Joomla) will be destroyed on each redeploy. We recommend to use FTP deploy at this time.</p>
