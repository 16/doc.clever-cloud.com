# Pricing
This is Clever Cloud charge your application's consumption.

## Instances

Instances are virtual machines which host and run your application's code.
These instances come in three sizes (aka flavors), which represent different levels of capacities (allocated RAM, allocated CPU).

Based on the needs of your app, the flavors are automatically adjusted. 

Java applications can't run on the *tiny flavor* since Java apps use a significant amount of RAM.

<div class="alert alert-hot-problems">
<h4>Please note:</h4>
	<p>The system checks consumption and takes Drops every ten minutes.</p>
</div>
<table class="table table-striped">
   <tr><th>Instance type</th><th colspan="2">Drops (per 10 min)</th></tr>
   <tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>PHP</th><th>Java</th></tr>
	<tr><td>Tiny flavor</td><td>1</td><td>-</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Medium flavor</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Large flavor</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr>
</table>

## Services

You can attach services to your apps (databases, cache systems, search enginesâ€¦).

As of now, MySQL and PostgreSQL are available.
