#Configuration files

This page describes the Clever Cloud configuration files for your applications.

All of the configuration files must be placed at the root of your project and use the JSON syntax. Please note that even if you use FTP to deploy your application, you must request a redeploy to apply the changes made on these files.

## Main configuration file

The main configuration file is called **cc_conf.json**, you will need it for some deployments and builds (mainly for your PHP and Java applications).

Here is the general syntax:
{% highlight javascript%}
    {
        "build": object,
        "deploy": object
    }
{% endhighlight %}

For more information about the available and mandatory keys for each language, please refer to the specific pages:
 * [Configuration files for PHP](/php-cc-conf/)
 * [Configuration files for Java](/java-cc-conf/)


Example of cc_conf.json for a Maven deploy:
{% highlight javascript%}
    {
      "deploy": {
        "goal": "-Dtest.active=false -Dexec.mainClass=\"com.example.Main\" assembly:jar-with-dependencies exec:java"
      }
    }

{% endhighlight %}

## CRON configuration file

The configuration file used for crontab is called **cc_cron.json**. It is only available for PHP applications at this time.

Here is the general syntax:
{% highlight javascript%}
    [
        "<string>",
        "<string>"
    ]
{% endhighlight %}

The string `<string>` must use the cron format\*:
<pre>M H d m Y command</pre>

There are two restrictions about the usage of crontab on our platform:

 * The special date `@reboot` is not available since the crontab is added after the startup of the instance
 * You must use the absolute path of commands

You can use the special variable `$ROOT` to refer to the root folder of your application.

Example of cc_cron.json which executes the file `cron.php` every 5 minutes:
{% highlight javascript%}
    [
        "*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/php $ROOT/cron.php"
    ]
{% endhighlight %}


### Note about crontab clustering

We do not currently support the clustering of crontab, you must manage it yourself if your application requires more than one instance.

_* For more information about the syntax, you can check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">this page</a>_

<script type="text/javascript">
$('#center a').click(function(){
    $('html, body').animate({
        scrollTop: $( $(this).attr('href') ).offset().top - 0
    }, 500);
    return false;
});
</script>
