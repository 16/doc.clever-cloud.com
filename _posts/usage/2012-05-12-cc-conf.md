#Configuration file

For every Java project using Maven, you need to write a small specific JSON
file, placed at the root of your project. Make sure this file is called **cc_conf.json**

This JSON is the configuration file that you will need for some deployments and builds. Here is the syntax:
{% highlight javascript%}
    {
        "build": {
            "type": "<string>",
            "goal": "<string>"
        },
        "deploy": {
            "javaVersion": <integer>,
            "goal": "<string>"
        }
    }
{% endhighlight %}


* ``"build"`` is an object with the goal to execute.
  * ``"type"`` can be ``"maven"`` or ``"ant"``.
  * ``"goal"`` is the target you want to use to build your project.
* ``"deploy"`` is an object containing the type of deploy (Maven, Ant or SBT) and the goal to execute.
  * ``"goal"``: the goal/target and options you want to execute to deploy/run you project.
  * ``"javaVersion"``: the version of java you want to use to run your app. Values: 6, 7. Default : 7.

Example of cc_conf.json for a Maven deploy:

{% highlight javascript%}
    {
      "deploy": {
        "goal": "-Dtest.active=false -Dexec.mainClass=\"com.example.Main\" assembly:jar-with-dependencies exec:java"
      }
    }

{% endhighlight %}

Example of cc_conf.json for Ant (available soon) build:

{% highlight javascript%}
    {
      "build": {
        "type": "ant",
        "goal": "exterminate -Ddoctor.version=11"
      }
    }
{% endhighlight %}
