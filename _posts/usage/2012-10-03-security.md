You can get a free  SSL certificate for every applications deployed on cleverapps.io domain.  
For now, there is no way for the app to know if the user use an encrypted connection or not.  
You have two choices:
* Either you force the SSL use 
* You don't use it

A functionnality will come soon to include a HTTP header inside your app.
