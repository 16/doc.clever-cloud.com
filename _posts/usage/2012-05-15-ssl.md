# SSL


By default, a SSL certificate is enabled for every applications deployed on *cleverapps.io*'s domains.  
For now, there is no way for the app to know if the user use an encrypted connection or not.  
You have two choices:
* Either you force the SSL use 
* You don't use it

A functionnality will come soon to include a HTTP header inside your app.
