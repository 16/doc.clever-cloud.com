#Services basics

The Clever Cloud allows you to use several services, like database (RDBMS, noSQL) or middleware. If you cannot find the services you need, please ask on <a href="mailto:support@clever-cloud.com">support@clever-cloud.com</a>.  

<div class="alert alert-hot-problems">
	<h4>Important note:</h4>
	<p>
		On the 2013-04-03, services (actually PostgreSQL and mySQL databases), will be managed in the <strong>Organisation</strong> area of the console, not in the <strong>Applications</strong> area anymore.
	</p>
	<p>For old databases created under <strong>Applications</strong>, the migration of this new User Experience is done by setting a tag automatically with the app's name.</p>
</div>


##Databases
 * You can use a [mySQL database](/mysql)
