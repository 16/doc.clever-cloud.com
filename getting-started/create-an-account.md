Create and account
==================


When you arrive on the admin panel, you see a form to log you, and a link to sign up. If you don't have any account, click on this one.

In the form, simply enter your email address and a password, then tick the box, and click the button. That's it ! We send you a confirmation e-mail.

Click on the link in this mail, and you'll be automatically connected to your profile.
