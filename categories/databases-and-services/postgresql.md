###Migrate from an old database
Some applications require a populated database to run properly. 
If you want to import your **SQL** dump, go to <a href="https://dbms-adminer.clever-cloud.com/adminer/">https://dbms-adminer.clever-cloud.com/adminer/</a>.

If you need to import a very large dump, please send an email to **support@clever-cloud.com**.
