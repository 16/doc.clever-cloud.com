3. Click on the services's button to create it. You will receive the associated credentials by email a few seconds later. <br>You can choose to store your credentials in Clever Cloud if you want to. Mail <support@clever-cloud.com> if you need to retrieve them.
4. Under **Installed** you will find your running services. A tagging system allows you to easily identify services for differents applications or purposes.
