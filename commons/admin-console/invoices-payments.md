## Make a payment

In the sidebar of the organization section, there are three alternatives to buy credit for your applications:

* Credit card (powered by Stripe)
* Paypal
* Bank transfer: we accept international bank transfers. This option will generate a reference that you will have to add to your bank transfert, as a note.


## Invoices

Invoices are available in the *Invoices* tab in the sidebar of the organization section. Once paid, invoices are moved to the "Paid invoice" table.

## Change Billing Information

* for personal account: available in *Profile > Informations*

* for organization: available in *Information > Billing details*
