## Analytics and consumption

An app is billed according to its consumption. Clever Cloud checks every ten minutes an apps consumption, and fire an event of consumption to your account.  
So you can monitor in real time through the console your apps consumptions the amount of credits you have consumed (drops).  

The charts in the homepage shows you how many Drops were consumed each days:<figure class="cc-content-imglarge"><img src="/assets/images/analytics.png"></figure>
