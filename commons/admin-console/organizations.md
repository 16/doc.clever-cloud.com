# Organizations

In order to improve team collaboration between developers, accountants, managers and admins, we have introduced organizations.

Once you created an organization, you can add collaborators and assign them [roles](#roles-and-privileges) which give them rights.


## Add an organization

Organization names are unique. It means that you cannot use an already used organization name.

In order to add an organization, just click on "Add an organization" in the top left sidebar:
