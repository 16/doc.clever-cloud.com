## Organisations

Clever Cloud has introduced organisations for easier billing management for users with differents activities or clients.

### Overview

Organisations simplify management of group-owned applications (for instance, your company's apps or your personal apps), with a permissions management system, to grant differents kinds of privileges to each member of your organisations.

### Getting Started

By default, after your account creation, you have your personal organisation. You can add members to it.

You can also create a new one, by clicking on "Add an organisation", located in the first dropdown of the navigation bar.
