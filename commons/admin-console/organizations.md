# Organizations

In order to improve team collaboration between developers, accountants, managers and admins, we have introduced organizations.

Once you create an organization, you can add collaborators and assign them [roles](#roles-and-privileges) which give them rights.


## Add an organization

Organization names are uniques. It means that you cannot use an organization name that is already used.

In order to add an organization, just click on "Add an organization" in the top left dropdown menu:
