# Intro to add-ons

Applications often requires one or more services in addition to the runtime itself. For example, you may need databases
for storing data, cache engine for performances, long time log storage, etc...

These services are called add-ons. There is a great number of them, based on many technologies, and developed by many
companies, or communities. It could be a database, a cache system or a search engine.
