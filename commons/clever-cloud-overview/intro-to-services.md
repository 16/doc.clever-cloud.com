## Intro to Services

Services are can be attached or not to an application. It could be a database, a cache system or a search engine. 

Services are internal and not provided by external partners. They all run on Clever Cloud core architecture.

Currently available services are listed below: 

* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* CouchBase
* File System Buckets

More will come pretty soon.


Services can run alone or not. It means that you can use Clever Cloud for just a service, or attach a service to an existing Clever Cloud application. It implies that in Clever Cloud dashboard, services management is outside application management. You can add tags to any service in order to quickly find them in the future.
