## Intro to Services

The aim of this article is to help you to make the difference between these three entities: 

* Apps
* Services
* Add-ons

These are all billable elements.

### Defining Services

First, services are declared on the Console. A service could be a database, a cache system or a search engine. Like Apps, Services' environment is embed into Clever Cloud's architecture: these are not external services.

Available services are listed below: 

* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* CouchBase
* File System Buckets

You can easily bind your Clever Cloud Apps to Clever Cloud Services. But you can also make an external use of Clever Cloud Services. That's why Services Management is outside of Apps Management in Clever Cloud's console.

Having many Services could be a bit hard to manage. Even with IDs, it's hard to identify each Services. That's why we've added a Tag-based management:
