# Troubleshoot deployment issues

Sometimes, when something goes wrong during the deployment, it can be hard to find out what happens.
The troubleshoot mode allows you to keep the instances up while you find out what has happened.
Additionally, the troubleshoot modes increases the overall verbosity of the deployment process.

To enable the troubleshoot mode, add `CC_TROUBLESHOOT=true` to your environment variables.
