#### Git and File Persistence

> “Some files dissapearing after an application restart”

Clever Cloud use Git to transfert your code and  application's assets from your localhost to your scaler. If your application writes files on the local file system, those files are not commited: so you can't save these files from a instance to an other.

For most of Cloud providers, the use of the file system is not a good practise. Bu we know it could be sometimes pretty useful. That's why we provide an on-demand file system, easily pluggable to your app. In that case, your files will not be stored on the Git filesystem, but on a clustered file system, dedicated to it, accessible via FTP. This is the FS Bucket addon.

Setup FS Bucket for your app is kinda straightforward, because it consist in add a simple Json file at the root of your application.

The Json containts two parameters: the ID of the FS Bucket, and the path you want to use as a FS.

#### Error about Empty Repository

> “Logs are telling that I may have cloned an empty repository”

#### SSH: Password is Asked 

> “When I try to push my app, the server respond by asking a password.” 

This occurs when a wrong ssh key has been entered in your Clever Cloud profile, in the dashboard. 

Most of the time, it's due to the presence of multiple ssh key, generated by 3rd party softwares, like Github for Mac.

#### Node failed to deploy

> “My Node.js application is unable to start. Logs are not helping” 

This kind of silent error may be due to the server port your have setup in your application. Make sur your application
