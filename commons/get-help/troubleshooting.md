#### <i class="icon-double-angle-right"></i> Git and File Persistence

> Why are my files disappearing after an application restart?”

Clever Cloud use Git to transfer your code and  application's assets from your localhost to your scaler. If your application writes files on the local file system, those files are not commited: so you can't save these files from a instance to an other.

For most of Cloud providers, the use of the file system is not a good practice. Bu we know it could be sometimes pretty useful. That's why we provide an on-demand file system, easily pluggable to your app. In that case, your files will not be stored on the Git file system, but on a clustered file system, dedicated to it, accessible via FTP. This is the FS Bucket add-on.

Setup FS Bucket for your app is kinda straightforward, because it consist in add a simple Json file at the root of your application.

The Json contains two parameters: the ID of the FS Bucket, and the path you want to use as a FS.

#### <i class="icon-double-angle-right"></i> Error about Empty Repository

> “Logs are telling me that I may have cloned an empty repository”

Most of the time, this error show up because of an empty repository. The origin may have several explanations:

*You just have created you Git repository and tried to push*   

You may have pushed a empty repository, and the files of your project have not been added properly. using the command `git add` will add the 

```bash
# Using the '.' after 'add' will add all the files to the index of git
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "commiting files"
```

*You are working on a non-master branch but pushed it to Clever Cloud*   

So you need to push your specific branch to master by using the following command. To do so, you have to explicitly mention your current local branch and the remote master branch using the following command:
  
```bash
$ git push <cleverRemote> <yourSpcificBranchName>:master
```

#### <i class="icon-double-angle-right"></i> SSH: Password is Asked 

> “When I try to push my app, the server respond by asking a password.” 

This occurs when a wrong ssh key has been entered in your Clever Cloud profile, in the dashboard. 

Most of the time, it's due to the presence of multiple ssh key, generated by 3rd party softwares, like Github for Mac. 

We strongly recommend using a single SSH key when interacting with Clever Cloud. But if you want to use multiple keys, the trick is to configure your local ssh by adding a custom Host to ~/.ssh/config (create it if it doesn't exist), generate a secondary ssh key specifically for your Clever Cloud account (e.g., ~/.ssh/id_rsa_clevercloud) and then execute ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_clevercloud from your local git project directory.

Your `.ssh/config` should loo like this:

```bash
#config for Clever Cloud specific key
Host ccloud
  Hostname push.clever-cloud.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_clevercloud
```

#### <i class="icon-double-angle-right"></i> Node failed to deploy

> “My Node.js application is unable to start. Logs are not helping” 

This kind of silent error may be due to the server port your have setup in your application. Make sure your app is listening on 8080.  
Most of the time, this simple line could do the trick in your main JS file:

```javascript
// Listen on port 8080
server.listen(8080);
```
