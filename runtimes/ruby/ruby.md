## Deploying Ruby on Rails apps

Clever Cloud allows you to deploy any RoR application. This page will
explain you how to set up your application to run it on our service.

You do not need to change a lot in your application, the *requierments* will help you to configure your apps with some mandatory files to add, and properties to setup.

### Overview


Ruby on Rails is an open source web application framework which runs on the Ruby programming language. It is a full-stack framework: it allows creating pages and applications that gather information from the web server, talk to or query the database, and render templates out of the box. As a result, Rails features a routing system that is independent of the web server.


### Create an application

1. Create a new app by clicking on the **Add an App** button, in the headbar. 
2. Enter your application's name and description and click "Next".
<figure class="cc-content-img">
  <img src="/assets/images/appjavawar.png"/>
</figure>
3. Then select the language/framework:  <figure class="cc-content-img"><img src="/assets/images/javawarapp.png"></figure>
4. Check that the information are correct and validate: <figure class="cc-content-img"><img src="/assets/images/appcreationreviewjavawar.png"></figure>
5. *Optional*: <a href="/databases-and-services/add-service/">add a database or service</a>

### Necessary information

Be sure that:

* you push in <b>master branch</b>

* you commit your <strong>Gemfile.lock</strong> file

* you have a <strong>config.ru</strong> file (This one is most of the time generated by rails)

### Requirements

First, your application must use rack. This implies that a config.ru
file is present.

Then, you need to provide a Gemfile.lock. To do that, please run

	```
	.../myapp $ bundle install ## That will generate Gemfile.lock
	.../myapp $ git add Gemfile.lock
	.../myapp $ git commit -m "Add production dependency file"
	```
