## Deploy static files

If you only need to serve static files without executing any code on the backend, for instance for a javascript Single Page Application (SPA), you can create a static application.

This runtime is based on apache, so shares a lot with the [PHP runtime](/doc/php/php-apps/). This means you can use `.htaccess` files for redirection or access control.

## Deploy on Clever Cloud

Application deployment on Clever Cloud is via **Git or FTP**. Follow
[these steps](/doc/clever-cloud-overview/add-application/) to deploy your application.
