## Selecting your java version

Simply set the environment variable **JAVA_VERSION** to the version you want

Accepted values are `6`, `7` and `8`

## Retrocompatibility with the old configuration system

The configuration of the JAVA_VERSION through the **clevercloud/java_version** file still works. This is totally backward compatible.
