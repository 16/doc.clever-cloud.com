# Deploy Go applications

Clever Cloud allows you to deploy any Go application. This page will
explain you how to set up your application to run it on our service.

You do not need to change a lot in your application, the *requirements* will help you configure your applications with some mandatory files to add, and properties to setup.

## Overview

Go, otherwise known as Golang, is an open source, compiled, garbage-collected, concurrent system programming language. It was first designed and developed at Google Inc. beginning in September 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.

## Create an application

Refer to the page [Deploy an application on Clever Cloud](/doc/clever-cloud-overview/add-application/).

## Necessary information

Be sure that:

* you push in <strong>master branch</strong>

* your application listens to the wild network <strong>0.0.0.0</strong>,
  not only localhost or 127.0.0.1

* your application listens on port <strong>8080</strong>

## Requirements

Apart from <strong>listening on port 8080</strong>, there is nothing to
change on your application.

We automatically build and run your application, as `go get myapp` would
build it. The executable is run with the application's root as its
current path. So if your application has a "static" folder at its root, it will be
accessible via "./static" in your application.

We currently support single module applications only. That means that
your sources files just need to be at the project's root, and you can't
have multiple modules running.

Also, the go tool requires that you put your main code in a file named `main.go`. If you
do not do that, go will generate a library and not an executable. So if you get a `Nothing
listening on port 8080`, please check that your main file is named `main.go`.

By default, we deploy your application as a go project named "<app_id>". This might not be
what you want. If your application has submodules and imports them with their full path *or* your main
project is an external package hosted, let's say, on github (like `github.com/mememe/myproject`),
you can define the `CC_GO_PKG=github.com/mememe/myproject` environment variable. We will
then run `go get ${CC_GO_PKG}` instead of running `go get <app_id>`.

## More configuration

By default, we consider that your repository contains a single
application. We put your application in ${GOPATH}/src/{app_id} and then
run `go get {app_id}`.

If you want to configure more precisely your dependencies (e.g. have
private libraries, or specific versions of some libraries), the
following will explain you how to do it:

1. Make your repository have a GOPATH structure:

``` haskell
./
   src/
      myapp/
      foo/
         module1/
         module2/
      module3/
```
<br />

Here you have the modules `myapp`, `foo/module1`, `foo/module2` and `module3`.

2. Create a *clevercloud/go.json* file at the top of your repository:

``` haskell
./
   clevercloud/
      go.json
   src/
      myapp/
      ...
```


3. In the go.json file, put the following:

```javascript
{
    "deploy": {
        "appIsGoPath": true,
        "main": "myapp"
    }
}
```
<br />

If `appIsGoPath` is present and equals `true`, then we consider that
your repo root is the *GOPATH*. the `main` field then becomes mandatory
and must be the name of the module you want to run. e.g. if you want
to run `module1`, `main` must be `foo/module1`.

4. (Optional) Add a "execDir" field to the "deploy" object:

```javascript
{
    "deploy": {
        "appIsGoPath": true,
        "main": "myapp"
        "execDir": "src/myapp"
    }
}
	```
<br />


The `execDir` value must be relative to the root of your repo. In the
example above, we will run the application in the src/myapp directory.

## Environment injection

Clever Cloud can inject environment variables that are defined in the
dashboard and by add-ons linked to your application.

To access your variable in your application, nothing simpler! Just get
it from your environment, like you would with `PATH`:
`os.Getenv("MY_VARIABLE")`.

## Customize build using environment variables

<table id="go_envs" class="table table-bordered, table-striped">
<thead>
<tr><th>Variable</th><th>Usage</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>CC_GO_PKG</td>
<td>
Makes the deployer run `go get ${CC_GO_PKG}` instead of `go get <app_id>`. This helps if
you have a "foobar/" folder/package in your "github.com/mememe/myproject" repo and a "main.go" on
the root containing `import "github.com/mememe/myproject/foobar"`.
If we run `go get <app_id>`, the deployer won't be able to find the "github.com/mememe/myproject/foobar" package.
Using that variable will prevent breaking that hierarchy.

## Deploy on Clever Cloud

Application deployment on Clever Cloud is via Git. Follow [these steps](/doc/clever-cloud-overview/add-application/) to deploy your application.
