# Deploy PHP apps

PHP is available on our platform with the version 5.5.11. You can use FTP or Git to deploy your applications.

## Overview

PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.

## Create an application

1. Create a new app by clicking on the **Add an application** button, in the headbar.
2. Select the language/framework: <figure class="cc-content-img"><img src="/assets/images/select-lang.png"/></figure>
3. Select between Git and FTP deployments.<figure class="cc-content-img"><img src="/assets/images/select-depl.png"/></figure>
3. Select the scalability options: <figure class="cc-content-img"><img src="/assets/images/select-scalab.png"/></figure>
3. Enter your application's name and description, choose your deployment zone and click "Create".
<figure class="cc-content-img"><img src="/assets/images/choose-name.png"/></figure>
5. *Optional*: <a href="/addons/add-an-addon/">add an add-on</a>

<div class="alert alert-hot-problems">
  <h4>Warning:</h4>
  <p>An FTP application is automatically started once the application is created, even if no code has been sent.</p>
  <p>
     When you create a FTP application, a free [FS Bucket](addons/clever-cloud-addons/#fs-buckets-file-system-with-persistance/) add-on is
     provisioned, named after the application. You will find the FTP
     credentials in the configuration tab of this add-on.
  </p>
</div>

##Configuration files for PHP applications

The configuration file for your PHP application must be
`clevercloud/php.json`, that is a *php.json* file in a *clevercloud*
folder at the root of your application.

### Change the webroot

Since one of the best practices of PHP development is to take the libraries and core files outside the webroot, you may want to set another webroot than the default one (*the root of your application*).

To change the webroot, just set the key `webroot` in the `deploy` part
of the configuration file *clevercloud/php.json* with the absolute path (*from the root of your application*) of your new public folder.

In the following example we want to set the webroot to the folder `/public`:

```javascript
  {
    "deploy": {
      "webroot": "/public"
    }
  }
```

Please note the absolute path style: `/public`.

<div class="alert alert-hot-problems">
<h4>Warning:</h4>
 <p>The change of the webroot will be rejected during the deployment if the target directory does not exist or is not a directory.</p>
</div>

### Change PHP settings

Most of PHP settings can be changed using a `.user.ini` file. Please refer to the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.file.per-user.php" target="_blank">official documentation</a> for more information.

Other settings can be changed by adding the following line in `clevercloud/php.json`:

```javascript
   {
      "configuration": {
         "mbstring.func_overload": 2,
         "another.setting": "value"
      }
   }
```

Here is the list of available settings:

* `mbstring.func_overload`

<strong>Note: </strong>You can send a request to the support if you need to change a setting which is not in this list.

#### Maximum PHP Children per instance

You can fix the maximum number of PHP running processes per instance by adding the following line in `clevercloud/php.json`:

```javascript
   {
      "configuration": {
         "pm.max_children": 32
      }
   }
```

This setting is usefull if you need to limit the number of running processes according to the maximum connections limit of your MySQL or PostgreSQL database.

By default, `pm.max_children` is set to **10**.


### Execute a custom script after the deploy

Some frameworks or custom applications might require bootstrapping before the application may run (_e.g. Composer_).
You can achieve this by creating a custom script with your commands and adding the following line in `clevercloud/php.json`:

```javascript
   {
      "hooks": {
         "postDeploy": "pathtoyourscript"
      }
   }
```

#### Example

You use Composer to manage dependencies of your project and you want to execute _composer.phar install_ before running your app.

First, add a file `ccbuild.sh` at the root of your project with these lines:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

php composer.phar install
```

Then add these lines in `clevercloud/php.json`:

```javascript
   {
      "hooks": {
         "postDeploy": "ccbuild.sh"
      }
   }
```

<strong>Note: </strong>You must add the _execute_ permission to your file (`chmod u+x yourfile`) before pushing it.


## Environment injection

Clever Cloud can inject environment variables that are defined in the
dashboard and by add-ons linked to your application.

To access the variables, use the `getenv` function. So, for example, if
your application has a postgresql add-on linked:

```php
<?php

$dbh = new PDO(
	'postgresql:host='.getenv("POSTGRESQL_ADDON_HOST").';dbname='.getenv("POSTGRESQL_ADDON_DB"),
	getenv("POSTGRESQL_ADDON_USER"),
	getenv("POSTGRESQL_ADDON_PASSWORD")
);
```

## Frameworks and CMS

The following is the list of tested CMS by our team.

It's quite not exhaustive, so it doesn't mean that other CMS can't work on the Clever Cloud platform.
