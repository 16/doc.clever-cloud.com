The goal of this article is to show you how to deploy a Node.js + MongoDB application on Clever Cloud.

The application is a very simple list. You can add and delete values. More information about the application:

*  [Clever Cloud demo](http://nodejs-mongodb.cleverapps.io/)


<br/>
If you want to test our platform and deploy this application, just follow these simple steps:

1. Fork the [Github repo](https://github.com/drouarb/nodejs-mongodb-demo).
2. Create an application from your github repo.
3. Create a [MongoDB add-on](/addons/clever-cloud-addons/) and link it to your application.
4. That's all the application will use the environment variables to connect to MongoDB.
